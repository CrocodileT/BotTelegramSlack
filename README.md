# BotTelegramSlack
This is a simple echo bot that can work in parallel in telegram and slack, it has basic commands: 
1. /start - getting started
2. /help in telegram, _help in Slack - help information
3. /repeat in telegram, _repeat in Slack - setting the number of repetitions (in a Telegram using a keyboard, in a slack using stickers with numbers), you can also enter a number from 1 to 5 in any messenger. 

If you entered /start the bot will repeat your message as many times as you set in /repeat (this is basically 1)
  Example of how the bot works:
